# tgff2json
Convert tgff file generated by TGFF to a corresponding json file.

Use tgff2json -h to find help information.

Use the following command to run:

./tgff2json filename.tgff

It outputs:
    
    filename.json

Currently, it only convert tasks and edges information. 
The communication and processor information will be updated later.


TODO:
    
    Extend it to support vcg files.
    
    Use dotty to plot the task graph.
